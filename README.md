## **Background**  
**Name:** Armielyn Obinguar  
**Role:** Developer Relations (DevRel) from the Philippines  

**Past Experiences:**  
- Former DevRel @Virtuals


**Motivation:**  
The Polkadot ecosystem is rapidly growing, with numerous DeFi protocols being built on its parachains. However, users and developers often face challenges in understanding DeFi mechanics, tracking performance, and optimizing their strategies. This AI agent will serve as a DeFi-focused assistant, providing real-time analytics, user support, and educational resources to empower users and developers in the Polkadot DeFi ecosystem.
