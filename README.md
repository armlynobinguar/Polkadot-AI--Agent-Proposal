# Polkadot AI Agent Proposal  
**Focus: Scraping Developer Resources & Providing Latest Tech Updates**  
---

## **Background**  
**Name:** Armielyn Obinguar  
**Role:** Developer Relations (DevRel) from the Philippines  

**Past Experiences:**  
- Former DevRel @Virtuals

## **Motivation**  
The Polkadot ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with new parachains, SDK updates, and governance proposals being introduced frequently. However, developers often struggle to keep up with the latest tech developments and find relevant resources. This AI-powered tool will serve as a **developer-focused assistant**, providing **scraped materials** and **real-time updates** to empower developers in the Polkadot ecosystem.  

---

## **Project Overview**  
The **Polkadot Developer Materials Scraper & Tech Updates Tool** is an AI-driven assistant designed to:  
1. **Scrape developer materials** (docs, tutorials, GitHub repos, etc.) from the Polkadot ecosystem.  
2. **Provide real-time updates** on the latest tech developments (e.g., new parachains, SDK updates, governance proposals).  
3. **Deliver curated content** to developers through a **CLI tool**, **Telegram bot**, and **Discord bot**.  

This document outlines a **four-week development schedule** to deliver a fully functional tool tailored to developer needs.
